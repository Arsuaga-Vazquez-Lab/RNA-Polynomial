# RNA-Polynomial

## Overview

This repository includes code and data for experiments in the following paper. 

[Pengyu Liu, Jacob Lusk, Mariel VÃ¡zquez, Analyzing the link between RNA secondary structures and R-loop formation with tree polynomials, *Preprint* (2023).](https://)

## Setup

Running the code requries [Matlab](https://matlab.mathworks.com) and additional [Matlab toolboxes](https://www.mathworks.com/products.html) including the Bioinformatics Toolbox and the Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox.

To run the code:
1. Clone (or download) this repository to a local directory.
2. Go to the folder *data* and unzip the files *pfc8_snrpn.zip* and *pfc53_airn.zip*.


## Usage

The function **dbn2pl.m** converts a dot-bracket notation of an RNA secondary structure without pseudoknots into a parent list of its tree representation of a selected type.

The function **pl2poly.m** then computes the corresponding polynomial with the parent list of the tree representation.

See the file **Example.m** for an example of using the functions to compute the tree polynomial representations of an RNA secondary structure.
